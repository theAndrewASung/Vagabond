what are we looking for?

We will also consider non-English AND English works specifically discussing multilingual issues, personal experiences with multilingualism, and languages.

The word limit for all written submissions is 2,000 words (roughly 5 pages single-spaced).
  
Art:
Seeking original art (e.g. photography, painting, drawing) submissions. All art submissions will be considered. However, we are specifically seeking art submissions focused on themes of multilingualism, multiculturalism, languages, travel, etc. We print at a quality of 300 DPI (300 dots per inch), so please try to submit materials that can be printed at that level.
