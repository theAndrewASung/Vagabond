<b>Written Work:</b> <br />
Seeking original, written, creative, work written in languages other than English.<br /> <br />
We will also consider non-English AND English works specifically discussing multilingual issues, personal experiences with multilingualism, and languages.
<br /><br />
The word limit for all written submissions is 2,000 words (roughly 5 pages single-spaced).
<br /><br />
<b>Artwork:</b><br />
Seeking original art (e.g. photography, painting, drawing) submissions. 
<br/><br />
All art submissions will be considered. However, we are specifically seeking art submissions focused on themes of multilingualism, multiculturalism, languages, travel, etc. 
<br/><br />
We print at a quality of 300 DPI (300 dots per inch), so please try to submit materials that can be printed at that level. Don't worry about
whether your art meets our print-quality needs-- we will let you know if we need a higher quality image!
